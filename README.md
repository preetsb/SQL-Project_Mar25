# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Whole lot of messy data about products, and transactions, and revenue but it is all meaningless with a lot missing. 
Trying to make sense of it all, to understand where customers are coming from and their behaviours in order to focus marketing efforts to maximize revenue. 


## Process
### Imported all the data into SQL from a .csv file. Explored the data, tried to get some sort of general sense of what is being conveyed and if there is a story happening. 
### Instead of cleaning up the data from the first step, I jumped right into the queries and just counted distinct values and eliminated the NULL values with the idea that it would still provide a (semi) accurate sense of how revenue was being earned. 

## Results

## Challenges
