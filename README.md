# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Whole lot of messy data about products, and transactions, and revenue but it is all meaningless with a lot missing. 
Trying to make sense of it all, to understand where customers are coming from and their behaviours in order to focus marketing efforts to maximize revenue. 


## Process
### Imported all the data into SQL from a .csv file. Explored the data, tried to get some sort of general sense of what is being conveyed and if there is a story happening. 
### Instead of cleaning up the data from the first step, I jumped right into the queries and just counted distinct values and eliminated the NULL values with the idea that it would still provide a (somewhat) accurate sense of how revenue was being earned. 

## Results
It looks like a general ecommerce store that sells a wide variety of good. It was not easy to ascertain some information with the incomplete data (and my elementary SQL skills) but I did notice that the top unique visitors by country did not match the top revenue earners which was intriguing and something I would explore more. The vast majority of the revenue is from the USA and they really like their custom decals.  


## Challenges 
The quality of the data (missing values, duplicates, confusing product names). I did what I could to clean it up but it was a challenge and I needed really complicated functions to find out some information. The primary challenge was that it was just so much data it was borderline incoherent and that's what made it frustrating but it's probably also similar to many real-life situations. 


## Future Goals
I would have dug deeper to find out how people are accessing the site and finding the product by connecting the search keyword and their ultimate purcahse. I probably gone even further and analyzed the *sentiment score* or tried to find out what *eccommerce action type* and *eccomerce action step* means, to map out the marketing funnel for the site.
